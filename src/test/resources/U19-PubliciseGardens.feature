#Feature: U19 - As Inaya, I want to be able to make my garden public so that others can see what Iâ€™m growing.
#
##  Scenario: #AC1 - Writing in sprint #3, I cannot finish this as we deferred the story for browsing gardens.
##    Given I click the one of the gardens from the list which I own
##    When I tick the checkbox labelled "Make my garden public"
##    Then My garden will be visible in search results.
#
#Scenario: #AC2
#  Given I click Create New Garden
#  When I add valid description of the garden, and I submit the form
#  Then The description is persisted.
