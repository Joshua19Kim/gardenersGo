Feature: U7002 - As Jackie Wei, I want to catalog identified plants into my personal collection, so that I can keep track of the plants I've discovered.

    Scenario: #AC2 - View plants belonging to a species
    Given I am logged in with email "a@gmail.com" and password "Password1!"
    When I click on an entry for a plant on my collections page
    Then I see a list of all the unique plants that I have collected before that belong to that plant species

  Scenario Outline: #AC3 - Save an identified plant
    Given I am logged in with email "a@gmail.com" and password "Password1!"
    And I have an image of a plant
    When the app identifies the plant image
    And the app displays the name and relevant details after identifying
    And I input a <name>, <description>, <latitude> and <longitude>
    Then my plant is saved
    Examples:
      | name      | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | latitude | longitude |
